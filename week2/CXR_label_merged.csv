 small.  Aside from atelectasis in the left lower lobe, the lungs are grossly
 clear.  Almost complete resolution of atelectasis in the left upper lobe.

 air-fluid level in the retrosternal region suggests the presence of a tiny
 pneumothorax and small effusion.  These are most likely located in the left

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding portable chest examination of ___.  There is status
 post sternotomy and the presence of surgical clips in the left anterior
 mediastinum are indicative of previous bypass surgery.  The heart size is at
 the upper limit of normal variation without typical configurational
 abnormality.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates. 
 There is a left-sided lateral obliterated pleural sinus at the lower lateral
 chest wall indicative of old pleural scars, probably related to previous
 bypass surgery, which showed pleural effusions postoperatively on examination
 of ___.  Absence of any blunting in the posterior pleural sinus
 speaks against acute pleural effusion and identifies the area as a pleural
 scar.

 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 has been interval placement of a left-sided pacer device with a lead seen
 extending to the expected location of the right ventricle and the coronary
 sinus.  There may also be a lead extending to the right ventricle, although
 this is not well seen on the current study.  Right lower hemithorax opacity is
 seen which may be due to underlying subpulmonic effusion with overlying
 atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Findings may
 also be due to elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  If patient able, suggest
 dedicated PA and lateral views for better evaluation.  There is prominence and
 indistinctness of the hila.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Patient
 is status post median sternotomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarged cardiac silhouette and engorged pulmonary hila with
 pulmonary vascular congestion may be due to CHF.  Right lower hemithorax
 opacity could be due to pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis and/or

 opacity is identified.  No gross effusion.  Right upper quadrant clips noted.

 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is little interval change. 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in place, as does the right subclavian PICC line. 
 Again there is opacification of the right base with obscuration of the

 lobe with associated pleural effusion, in the appropriate clinical setting
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.  Probable atelectatic
 changes at the left base."

 Veil-like opacification over the right hemithorax is probably largely pleural
 effusion, but it obscures the lungs and makes it impossible to exclude
 interstitial edema or even lower lobe atelectasis.  On the left, the
 opacification at the bases is so severe that it is possible to diagnose likely
 collapsed, alternatively pneumonia.  The left pleural effusion is small and
 left lung demonstrates mild edema.  Mild cardiac enlargement is stable.  Left

 There is no significant pneumothorax.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 present.  Lung volumes remain low, with bibasilar atelectasis.  The diaphragm

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same
 day, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Four frontal images of the chest demonstrate a Dobbhoff tube that
 is folded over the stomach and reenters the esophagus to the level of the mid
 chest.  Another image demonstrates the Dobbhoff tube folding over in the
 stomach and entering the distal esophagus.  From discussion with the medical
 team, it appears that the tube was initially in the position with the tip in
 the mid chest and subsequently repositioned to the tube tip being in the
 distal esophagus.  The chest radiograph is otherwise essentially unchanged
 from imaging earlier the same day.  Continued opacification at the right lung
 base is again seen, consistent with volume loss and small right effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dobbhoff tube is seen in two different positions, both of which
 show the tube tip to be within the esophagus.  The tube will need to be
 repositioned to place the tip within the stomach.  Otherwise, essentially

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recent MVC with ileocecectomy and IR drain placement for
 hepatic necrosis, assess for cause of fever and abdominal pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Since the prior
 exam, there has been no significant change.  The right pleural effusion with
 right basal atelectasis is essentially stable.  An air-fluid level in the
 right upper quadrant corresponds with a collection in the right hepatic lobe,
 better assessed on the prior CT scan.  The left lung remains clear.  No
 definite signs of new consolidation.  No pulmonary edema.  Overall,
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Bony structures are intact.

 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 2.7 cm above
 the level of the carina.  Enteric tube seen coursing below the level of the
 diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image, but side port appears to
 be in the left upper quadrant in expected location of the stomach.  There is
 left base opacity which may represent combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis or underlying consolidation due to aspiration or contusion. 
 Additional left perihilar opacity is seen which may also relate to aspiration,
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, or infection.  There is slight blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle and a trace pleural effusion may be present.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  The superior
 mediastinum remains widened although slightly less prominent as compared to
 this prior study and findings are likely accentuated by supine position in the
 AP technique.  However, if there is clinical concern for acute mediastinal
 injury, CT is more sensitive.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate position.
 2.  Left base opacity may be combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis
 with also aspiration.  Additional opacity in the left lung may be due to
 additional areas of aspiration, although infection or contusion/pulmonary
 hemorrhage is not excluded within the appropriate clinical setting.
 3.  Possible trace right pleural effusion.

 position and AP technique and appears slightly less prominent as compared to
