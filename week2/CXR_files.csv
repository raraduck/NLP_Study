 HISTORY:  Metastatic disease with known pulmonary metastases, presenting with
 fever and leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ as well as CT of the abdomen
 and pelvis from that same day.  Radiographs are also available from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged, allowing for differences in technique.  There are a
 number of round nodular densities projecting over each upper lung, but more
 numerous and discretely visualized in the left upper lobe, similar to prior
 study.  However, in addition, there is a more hazy widespread opacity
 projecting over the left mid upper lung which could be compatible with a
 coinciding pneumonia.  Pulmonary nodules in the left upper lobe are also not
 completely characterized on this study.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Post-operative changes are similar along the right chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing left lung opacification which may reflect pneumonia
 superimposed on metastatic disease, although other etiologies such as
 lymphangitic pattern of metastatic spread could be considered.  CT may be
 helpful to evaluate further if needed clinically."

 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 AP FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A triangular opacity in the right lung apex is
 new from prior examination.  There is also fullness of the right hilum which
 is new. The remainder of the lungs are clear.  Blunting of bilateral
 costophrenic angles, right greater than left, may be secondary to small
 effusions.  The heart size is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe pneumonia or mass.  However, given right hilar
 fullness, a mass resulting in post-obstructive pneumonia is within the
 differential.  Recommend chest CT with intravenous contrast for further
 assessment.

 preceding portable chest examination of ___.  There is status
 post sternotomy and the presence of surgical clips in the left anterior
 mediastinum are indicative of previous bypass surgery.  The heart size is at
 the upper limit of normal variation without typical configurational
 abnormality.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates. 
 There is a left-sided lateral obliterated pleural sinus at the lower lateral
 chest wall indicative of old pleural scars, probably related to previous
 bypass surgery, which showed pleural effusions postoperatively on examination
 of ___.  Absence of any blunting in the posterior pleural sinus
 speaks against acute pleural effusion and identifies the area as a pleural
 scar.

 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  The lung
 volumes are low which results in vascular crowding.  However, despite this,
 there appear to be bibasilar, right greater than left, nodular opacities and
 interstitial thickening.  There is likely a small right pleural effusion. 
 Heart size is normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are no suspicious
 osseous lesions.  Multiple dilated loops of small bowel are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar opacities would be consistent with pneumonia and/or aspiration
 in the right clinical setting.  Likely some component of pulmonary edema given
 the interstitial thickening.
 2.  Multiple dilated loops of small bowel may represent ileus or obstruction. 
 Dedicated abdominal radiograph may be performed for better characterization."

 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Endotracheal tube has been slightly
 withdrawn in the interval, now terminating approximately 5 cm from the carina.
 A Dobbhoff tube is noted with tip in the fundus of the stomach.  A nasogastric
 tube is also seen, with tip at the level of the gastroesophageal junction, and

 HISTORY:  Sepsis with mitral regurgitation and possible worsening pulmonary
 edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the bibasilar opacification
 has somewhat decreased bilaterally.  The time course suggests that much of
 this appearance may have reflected improved pulmonary edema.  Nevertheless,
 there is continued engorgement of pulmonary vessels more prominent on the
 right, consistent with some persistent elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
 Hazy opacification on the right suggests pleural fluid.
 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would certainly
 have to be considered.  Loss of the medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm
 suggests some volume loss in the retrocardiac portion of the lower lobe."

 lateral view, aside from a calcified granuloma inseparable from a heavily
 calcified mitral annulus, the lungs are clear aside from what may be a small
 region of severe bronchial wall thickening in the right middle lobe.  There is
 no pulmonary edema.  Right pleural effusion is tiny compared to large pleural
 effusions seen at various times on prior chest radiographs.
 
 There are no findings to suggest intrathoracic malignancy or infection.  
 
 Heart size is normal, hilar and peripheral pulmonary vasculature are also
 normal.

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 has been interval placement of a left-sided pacer device with a lead seen
 extending to the expected location of the right ventricle and the coronary
 sinus.  There may also be a lead extending to the right ventricle, although
 this is not well seen on the current study.  Right lower hemithorax opacity is
 seen which may be due to underlying subpulmonic effusion with overlying
 atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Findings may
 also be due to elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  If patient able, suggest
 dedicated PA and lateral views for better evaluation.  There is prominence and
 indistinctness of the hila.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Patient
 is status post median sternotomy.

 Otherwise, left base atelectasis has improved compared with the prior study.
 There is upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is is probably unchanged allowing for technical
 differences. Suspect background COPD. Nodular density at the right lung base
 projecting between the anterior fifth and sixth ribs was not seen on prior

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same
 day, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Four frontal images of the chest demonstrate a Dobbhoff tube that
 is folded over the stomach and reenters the esophagus to the level of the mid
 chest.  Another image demonstrates the Dobbhoff tube folding over in the
 stomach and entering the distal esophagus.  From discussion with the medical
 team, it appears that the tube was initially in the position with the tip in
 the mid chest and subsequently repositioned to the tube tip being in the
 distal esophagus.  The chest radiograph is otherwise essentially unchanged
 from imaging earlier the same day.  Continued opacification at the right lung
 base is again seen, consistent with volume loss and small right effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dobbhoff tube is seen in two different positions, both of which
 show the tube tip to be within the esophagus.  The tube will need to be

 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 2.7 cm above
 the level of the carina.  Enteric tube seen coursing below the level of the
 diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image, but side port appears to
 be in the left upper quadrant in expected location of the stomach.  There is
 left base opacity which may represent combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis or underlying consolidation due to aspiration or contusion. 
 Additional left perihilar opacity is seen which may also relate to aspiration,
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, or infection.  There is slight blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle and a trace pleural effusion may be present.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  The superior
 mediastinum remains widened although slightly less prominent as compared to
 this prior study and findings are likely accentuated by supine position in the
 AP technique.  However, if there is clinical concern for acute mediastinal
 injury, CT is more sensitive.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate position.
 2.  Left base opacity may be combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis
